# Jetpack Boilerplate

A minimal boilerplate project designed to kickstart new Android application development. This boilerplate is pre-configured with a modern tech stack, including Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack Navigation 3, and an **alpha version of Compose BOM to explore the latest Material 3 expressive features**.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Minimal Setup:** Intentionally lean to provide a clean slate for your project.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** Built with a modern declarative UI toolkit.
*   **Material 3 Expressive (via Alpha Version):** Experiment with the latest Material Design 3 expressive features using an alpha version of Compose BOM.
*   **Hilt:** For robust dependency injection.
*   **Navigation 3:** For navigating between composable screens (leveraging the latest navigation patterns).
*   **MVVM Architecture:** A foundational MVVM pattern to get you started.
